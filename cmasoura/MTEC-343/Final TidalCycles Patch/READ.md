# **Final TidalCycles Patch**
## Christina Masoura - MTEC-343-001


For the final project I wanted to do a small beat with the spoken numbers samples and a simple sawtooth melody.


The first three line with their alterations are the drums patterns.
```javascript
d1 $ sound "bd(5,8)"
d1 $ sound "bd*4" # gain "1.3"

d2 $ s "~ ~ ~ hh*4"
d2 $ s "bd _ bd hh*4"

d3 $ s "[bd(3,8), cp(2,8), hh(7,8), bass:1(7,16)]"
```

The first bass that is heard is a simple bass with a changing low pass filter.
```javascript
d4 $ s "bass:5*8" # lpf (range 200 5000 $ sine)
```

Then, there is the numbers pattern in which the first line only plays one sample and the speed of it is alternating, and the second line is playng many samples to create a potential polyrhythmic effect.

 ```javascript
d5 $ sound "numbers:1"  #speed "0.5"
d5 $ sound "numbers:1 numbers:2 numbers:3 numbers:4 numbers:5" # speed "1"
```

Then, a second bass line is added.
 ```javascript
d6 $ sound "jvbass [jvbass jvbass] jvbass ~" # iter 3 (note "1 [3 5] 7")
```

And finally, the sawtooth melody line, that is repeated in various octaves.

 ```javascript
d7 $ slow 2 $ note "gs5 g5 d6 c6 gs5 g5 [d6 c6] d6" # s "superzow" # gain "0.5"  |+ note 24
 ```

I am also adding these mute/solo/hush functions that are very useful in the time of the performance.
 ```javascript
unmute 1
mute 5
solo 1
mute 7
solo 7
unsolo 1
unmute 1
unsoloAll
unmuteAll

hush
```
